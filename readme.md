# Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware

## This is a fork of the massdrop fork of qmk
This fork has specific modifications for the Massdrop ALT. 
Added glitter/cloud effect, customized my personal keymap, and added funcitonality for a 'game mode' led map. The 'game mode' for leds keeps the key layout the same but can change RGB layouts with a keycode.
